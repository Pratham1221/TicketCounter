# TicketCounter
This is a tickets buying and selling platorm where organisers can sell their tickets
and people can buy tickets for their favourite shows. People who want to 
sell their tickets can use this platform to sell tickets in "pdf"
 form where the ticket will have the desired credentials of the person buying their tickets.

I am really excited for this project as it is my very first java project and I personally feel it 
can be used by people and have some real life help but in worst case if it turned out to be redundant I will 
definitley use it if I ever organised an event.
